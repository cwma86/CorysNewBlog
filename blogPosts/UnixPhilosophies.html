                                        <h1>Introduction</h1>

                                        <p class=MsoNormal>The U.S Bureau of Labor and Statistics lists Software
                                        Developer as one of the highest ranking career paths, with a medium Pay of $107,510
                                        and 10 year job growth outlook of 22% (much faster than average)(Bureau
                                        of Labor Statistics). As more and more developers get brought on by companies
                                        to create new software products, maintain old ones, and expand the
                                        functionality to existing programs there becomes more and more need to make
                                        software systems that can be easily understood, updated, and modified. I
                                        believe the explosive growth of this industry over the past 40 years, and
                                        continued expansion, owes great thanks to the Unix philosophies. Through this
                                        report I will address the 3 key philosophies of UNIX that were summarized by
                                        Peter H. Salus. Additionally I will dive into detail of how the programs
                                        provided with Unix follow this philosophy, and finally I will dive into how
                                        these programs adherence to the philosophies can be used to assist developers.</p>

                                        <h1>What is the Unix Philosophy</h1>

                                        <p class=MsoNormal>Back in 1994, the computer scientist Peter Henry Salus
                                        summarized the Unix philosophy in his book A Quarter Century of UNIX. He
                                        summarized this philosophy as Write programs that do one thing and do it well,
                                        Write programs to work together, and Write programs to handle text streams,
                                        because that is a universal interface(Salus). Write programs that do one
                                        thing and do it well describes making small programs that can be easily
                                        understood, edited, and tested. Write programs to work together describes how
                                        programs should be developed to be building blocks of future programs that can
                                        be reused without duplicate effort. Finally, Write programs to handle text
                                        streams, because that is a universal interface encourages the concept of
                                        common interface between programs and the choice of text streams avoid programmatic
                                        incompatibility with things like binary input formats and user input.</p>

                                        <h1>Standard Unix programs that follow these philosophies</h1>

                                        <p class=MsoNormal>Next we will look into how some standard Unix programs adhear
                                        to this philosophy. While discussing standard Unix programs for this section,
                                        I will try to focus on those also used by Unix and Unix-like operating systems
                                        such as Linux. At the heart of these operating systems, GNU core utilities, is
                                        a great example of a set of programs that follows the Unix philosophies
                                        mentioned previously. These core utils such as `ls` (for listing files), `grep`
                                        (for searching text), and tar (archiving files) are a few examples of programs
                                        that do one thing, can be connected in sequence to work together, and use test
                                        streams to provide a universal interface between each of them. `ls` for
                                        example, by default performs the simple task of printing the names of files in
                                        a current working directory, ls can also receive input from various text stream
                                        to perform tasks like listing only files of a certain type, and finally its
                                        output comes in the form of a text stream that can be used as input for other
                                        programs. </p>

                                        <h1>What can be done using these programs</h1>

                                        <p class=MsoNormal>In effort to further elaborate, how these philosophies work
                                        together I would like to discuss how the 3 simple GNU core utilities mentioned
                                        previously can be combined together to perform a multitude of tasks. For my
                                        first example, let us pretend we have a file system directory with 100 files,
                                        10 of those files have the work tom in their name, text containing the work
                                        dog, and we want to compress those 10 files into a single tar archive. Due to
                                        the adherence to the linux philosophies the three programs can be linked
                                        together to perform this use case using the command `tar cvf netar.tar $(ls
                                        *tom* | grep l dog *). This is done be providing the output of ls *tom* as a
                                        text stream to grep which will provide a text stream of all the files from that
                                        list with the contents of dog, and finally that text stream will be provided as
                                        a text stream to tar which can archive that list of files together into a
                                        singular package</p>

                                        <span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'><br

                                        </span>

                                        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

                                        <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

                                        <h1>Why is this helpful to developers</h1>

                                        <p class=MsoNormal>While the previous section, provides a very simplified case
                                        of how a few GNU core utilities adherence to the Unix philosophy can turn
                                        programs into building blocks that can be strung together to perform various
                                        tasks. It should be easy to see how this philosophy can be used on any program
                                        developed to create these building blocks, that can not only be easily
                                        maintained but also strung together to solve an infinite number of problems of
                                        varying complexity. While this building block concept is not unique in its
                                        ability to solve these problems, it is unique in the way that it does so at a
                                        small understandable component level. This enables current and future
                                        developers to continually expand on the work done by developers of the past.
                                        Thanks to the Unix philosophies this development of software as building blocks
                                        has been a primary driver in the unprecedented expansion of this industry. </p>

                                        <h1>Conclusion</h1>

                                        <p class=MsoNormal>The intent of this paper was to inform developers on the
                                        Linux philosophies, as well as demonstrate how they establish the basis of Unix
                                        and Unix-like operating system applications. These Linux philosophies establish
                                        the concepts of small, modular, and re-usable software designs that have been
                                        proven to be an effective means of software development by allowing users to
                                        take previously developed functionality and allocating it in new ways. .
                                        Additional, these philosophies promote small simple programs which make them
                                        easier for new developers to learn, diagnose bugs, and fix issues which
                                        significantly improves maintainability. I hope that report, has convinced you
                                        of the benefits of development using these core Unix philosophies. </p>
